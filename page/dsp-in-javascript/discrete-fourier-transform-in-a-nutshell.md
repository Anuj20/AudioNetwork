## Discrete Fourier Transform in a nutshell



- much simpler than FFT but ultra slow
- explain frequency domain and time domain, frequency bin [IMAGE]
- tell about samplesPerPeriod -> a way to skip sampling frequency
- add couple of sine waves together [CHART separate and sum]
- describe algorithm, running circle  [CHART]
- show that we collect vectors per each sample [CHART]
- when input signal contains that frequency it will produce lots of vectors that points to the same direction
- sum of vectors is power of sin wave frequency that we are looking at, direction is phase of that sine wave
