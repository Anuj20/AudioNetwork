Introcution to Web Audio API 
    - show how to initialize context
    - how to play something on speakers
    - how to grab microphone input and use AnalyzerNode

    [EXAMPLE] create example with simple Web Audio API initialization

Improovements to carrier recovery and generate classs
    - RECOVEY show interface and how to use (image + description that we can add samples but compute dft only in partucular moment)
    - GENERATE show how to add something to queue

    [EXAMPLE] link to example that already exists

Digital modulation techniques
    - amplidute shift keying
    - frequency shift keying
    - phase shift keying
    - show examples from modern technologies for example PSK-256
    - show gray code 

Example application
    - explain why we didn't use PSK (because of offset)
    - IMAGE and description about picking DFT output in particular moments (not every sample)
    - explain all terminology: guard interval etc

    [EXAMPLE] very simple only 4 dots 
    [EXAMPLE] with all charts
