# Examples

You may wonder why I didn't use any framework like AngularJs. Sometimes
even I asked that question to myself because writing in pure JavaScript
is often a pain ;) In general I wanted to keep those examples free from
any dependencies.
Examples are also in ES5. The reason was to keep it as simple as possible.
For people that worked with JS some time ago stuff like webpack, ES6, Babel
and others might be little scary. In general you can just grab the scripts
and run it directly in the browser.
Those examples are also some kind of playground. I check ideas here before
I add some new feature to the AudioNetwork main project.
